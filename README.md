Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m Hamed Alizadeh, a passionate PhD graduate in machine learning and its application in processing satellite and airborne imagery. My research focuses on leveraging AI and data-driven methods to extract meaningful insights from Earth observation data.

Beyond academia, I’m deeply interested in building intelligent systems at scale to tackle real-world challenges—from environmental monitoring to automated AI agents. I develop end-to-end AI solutions using tools like Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SQL, LangGraph, LangChain, and cloud platforms such as GCP.
